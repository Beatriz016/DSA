# How it works:

# Go through the array to find the lowest value.
# Move the lowest value to the front of the unsorted part of the array.
# Go through the array again as many times as there are values in the array.

# [ 7, 12, 9, 11, 3]
# [ 3, 7, 12, 9, 11]
# [ 3, 7, 9, 12, 11]
# [ 3, 7, 9, 11, 12]

# Selection Sort Implementation
